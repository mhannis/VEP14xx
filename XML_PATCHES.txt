Dell DiagOS XML patches (required on Proxmox)

Background:
Dell’s DiagOS tooling expects certain platform devices on /dev/i2c-1.
On Proxmox (Debian-based) on VEP14xx / EDGE6xxVN, the TC654/LM75/etc are on /dev/i2c-0.
If unpatched, tools like fantool/temptool/ledtool will fail to read sensors.

Patch:
Replace all occurrences of /dev/i2c-1 with /dev/i2c-0 in these files:

  /etc/dn/diag/default_fan_list.xml
  /etc/dn/diag/default_temp_sensors.xml
  /etc/dn/diag/default_led_list.xml
  /etc/dn/diag/default_pl_list.xml   (optional unless using pltool/CPLD access)

One-liners:
  sed -i 's#/dev/i2c-1#/dev/i2c-0#g' /etc/dn/diag/default_fan_list.xml
  sed -i 's#/dev/i2c-1#/dev/i2c-0#g' /etc/dn/diag/default_temp_sensors.xml
  sed -i 's#/dev/i2c-1#/dev/i2c-0#g' /etc/dn/diag/default_led_list.xml
  sed -i 's#/dev/i2c-1#/dev/i2c-0#g' /etc/dn/diag/default_pl_list.xml

Notes:
- Run as root (no sudo required if already root).
- These files are installed by the Dell DiagOS .deb and may be overwritten by reinstall/upgrade.
- If tools still fail, verify i2c modules are loaded: i2c-dev, i2c-i801, i2c-ismt.
